## 👏🏽 Contributing Guidelines 

We keep an updated list of bugs/feature requests in [Github Issues](https://github.com/stabledao-io/stabledao-frontend/issues). 


![GitHub issues](https://github.com/stabledao-io/stabledao-frontend/issues?style=flat-square)

Filter by ["good first issue"](https://github.com/stabledao-io/stabledao-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get your feet wet!
Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master.
